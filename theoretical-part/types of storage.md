 introduction
A file structure allow applications to **read , write** and **modify** data.  It might also support **finding** the data that matches some search criteria or **reading through** the data in some particular order

## DATA STORAGE

### 1- Primary Storage
Primary storage refers to the computer's memory, which connects **directly** to the computer's CPU. which known as random access memory (RAM) which is a **volatile** form of storage.

**Volatile** storage means that you totally **lose data** when you switch the system off.

Aside from the RAM, two other **primary** storage areas can be found; these are on the CPU itself; the Processor **registers** and the Processor **cache**.

<u>The Processor register</u> is some form of small storage which **resides** on the CPU and can contain data which can be accessed **quickly**.
<u></u>
The processor registers are measured by the **amount of data** the can hold, that is either, 8 bit, 32 bit or 64 bit.

<u>Processor cache</u> on the other hand is used by the CPU for **reducing** the time it takes to access the main memory.

It stores data coming from the **most frequently used applications** of the CPU.

During normal operations, the CPU checks the processor cache **before** checking the main memory, making the processing time **faster**.

### 2- Secondary Storage
Secondary storage devices are external in **nature** and **non-volatile** as compared to primary storage devices.

Secondary storage devices **do not lose data** even when they are **turned off**. Hence, they are the ideal back-up and data storage devices.

Examples of secondary storage devices include; Hard disk, CD and DVD , flash memory , floppy disks , magnetic tape , RAM disks , also called SSDs , ZIP drives , and punch cards.

Since secondary storage devices are **not attached** to the computer's CPU, it takes a **longer time** for the CPU to access them.

Secondary storage devices need to be **formatted** before they can store data.

Secondary storage devices are formatted based on a filesystem format and data are organized into files and directories.

It also includes other pertinent information about the data, which is described in what is called the **metadata**.

### 3- Tertiary Storage
This type of computer storage device is not as popular as the other two storage device types.

Its main use is for storing data at a **very large-scale**. This includes optical jukeboxes and tape libraries.

Tertiary storage devices **require a database** to organize the data that are stored in them, and the computer needs to go through the database to access those data.

### 4- Offline Storage

It is **not directly** connected to the computer and is used as a transfer **medium only**.

Offline storage devices are remotely located and accessed as **per need** only.

This storage device also needs **human intervention** to be read properly by the main computer system.
