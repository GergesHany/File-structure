- #### An index is a table containing a list of keys associated with a reference field pointing to the record where the information referenced by the key can be found.

- #### `An index` lets you impose order on a file `without rearranging the file`
  - `Data file:` It is not a requirement for the record to be in order 
  - `Index file:` The record must be in order

- #### `A simple index` is simply an array of (key, reference) pairs which is ordered by the field of the file.
    - `Reference:` Stores the address of the record
    - Used to do direct access inside data file.

- #### You can have different indexes for the same data: multiple access paths.
- #### `Indexing` gives us `keyed access to variable-length record files`
- #### `Index` is called an `access path` on the field
- #### `The index` file occupies `less disk blocks than` the data file because its entries are `much smaller`
- #### Indexes can also be characterized as `dense` or `sparse`
   - `A dense index`: has an index entry for `every search key value` (every record) in the data file.
   -  `A Sparse index`: has an index entry `for only some search` key value (some records) in the data file.

- #### Types of single level indexes: `Primary index`, `Clustering index`, `Secondary index`
- #### An Example of a Simple Index for Entry-Sequenced Files: We choose to organize the file as a series of variable- length records with a size field preceding each record.

- #### `The fields within each record` are also of `variable-length` but are `separated by delimiters`
- ####  We form a `primary key` by concatenating the record company label code and the recordâ€™s ID number. This should form a `unique identifier`
- #### In order to provide `rapid keyed access`, we build a `simple index` with a `key field` associated with a `reference field`
- #### `Reference field` provides the `address of the first byte` of the corresponding data record.
- #### The index may be sorted while the file does not have to be. This means that the data file may be `entry sequenced`: the record occurs in the order they are entered in the file.

<hr>

- #### `The index` is `easier to use than the data file` because
  - it uses `fixed-length records`
  - It is likely to be much `smaller than the data file`

- #### By requiring fixed-length records in the index file, we impose a limit on the size of the primary key field. This could cause problems
- #### The index could `carry more information than` the `key and reference fields` (e.g., we could keep the length of each data file record in the index as well)

<hr>

- #### Assumption: `index is small enough` to be held in memory.
   - `Create` the original empty index and data file.
   -  `Load` the index into memory `before using it`
   -  `Rewrite` the index file from memory `after using it`
   -  `Add` records to the data file and index
   -  `Delete` records from the data file
   -  `Update` records in the data file

- #### The index is represented `as an array of records`
- #### `The loading` into memory can be done `sequentially`, reading `a large number of index records` (which are short) `at once`
- #### What happens `if the index changes`, but its `rewriting does not take place or takes place` incompletely?
   - `Use a mechanism` for indicating whether or not the index is out of date.
   - Have a procedure that `reconstructs the index from the data file` in case it is out of date.
