<p>introduction<br>
A file structure allow applications to <strong>read , write</strong> and <strong>modify</strong> data.  It might also support <strong>finding</strong> the data that matches some search criteria or <strong>reading through</strong> the data in some particular order<br>
<br> <br> <br></p>
<h2 id="data-storage">DATA STORAGE</h2>
<h3 id="primary-storage">1- Primary Storage</h3>
<p>Primary storage refers to the computer’s memory, which connects <strong>directly</strong> to the computer’s CPU. which known as random access memory (RAM) which is a <strong>volatile</strong> form of storage.</p>
<p><strong>Volatile</strong> storage means that you totally <strong>lose data</strong> when you switch the system off.</p>
<p>Aside from the RAM, two other <strong>primary</strong> storage areas can be found; these are on the CPU itself; the Processor <strong>registers</strong> and the Processor <strong>cache</strong>.</p>
<p><u>The Processor register</u> is some form of small storage which <strong>resides</strong> on the CPU and can contain data which can be accessed <strong>quickly</strong>.<br>
<u></u><br>
The processor registers are measured by the <strong>amount of data</strong> the can hold, that is either, 8 bit, 32 bit or 64 bit.</p>
<p><u>Processor cache</u> on the other hand is used by the CPU for <strong>reducing</strong> the time it takes to access the main memory.</p>
<p>It stores data coming from the <strong>most frequently used applications</strong> of the CPU.</p>
<p>During normal operations, the CPU checks the processor cache <strong>before</strong> checking the main memory, making the processing time <strong>faster</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="secondary-storage">2- Secondary Storage</h3>
<p>Secondary storage devices are external in <strong>nature</strong> and <strong>non-volatile</strong> as compared to primary storage devices.</p>
<p>Secondary storage devices <strong>do not lose data</strong> even when they are <strong>turned off</strong>. Hence, they are the ideal back-up and data storage devices.</p>
<p>Examples of secondary storage devices include; Hard disk, CD and DVD , flash memory , floppy disks , magnetic tape , RAM disks , also called SSDs , ZIP drives , and punch cards.</p>
<p>Since secondary storage devices are <strong>not attached</strong> to the computer’s CPU, it takes a <strong>longer time</strong> for the CPU to access them.</p>
<p>Secondary storage devices need to be <strong>formatted</strong> before they can store data.</p>
<p>Secondary storage devices are formatted based on a filesystem format and data are organized into files and directories.</p>
<p>It also includes other pertinent information about the data, which is described in what is called the <strong>metadata</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="tertiary-storage">3- Tertiary Storage</h3>
<p>This type of computer storage device is not as popular as the other two storage device types.</p>
<p>Its main use is for storing data at a <strong>very large-scale</strong>. This includes optical jukeboxes and tape libraries.</p>
<p>Tertiary storage devices <strong>require a database</strong> to organize the data that are stored in them, and the computer needs to go through the database to access those data.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="offline-storage">4- Offline Storage</h3>
<p>It is <strong>not directly</strong> connected to the computer and is used as a transfer <strong>medium only</strong>.</p>
<p>Offline storage devices are remotely located and accessed as <strong>per need</strong> only.</p>
<p>This storage device also needs <strong>human intervention</strong> to be read properly by the main computer system.<br>
