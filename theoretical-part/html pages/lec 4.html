<td>1</td>
<td>Tapes provide no direct access facility, but very rapid sequential access to data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Tapes are easy to store and transport and cheaper than disk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Taped was used to store application data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Tapes are primarily used as archival storage. Data in tapes are copied to disk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Tapes are commonly used as backup devices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Data on tapes is no need for addresses to identify the locations of data on a tape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>On a tape, the logical position of a byte within a file corresponds directly to its physical position relative to the start of the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>The surface of a typical tape can be seen as a set of parallel tracks each of which is a sequence of bits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>If there are nine tracks, the nine bits that are at corresponding positions in the nine tracks are taken to constitute one byte + a parity bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>One Byte = a one-bit-wide slice of tape called a frame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>Frames are organized into data blocks + interblock gaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>The parity bit is not a part of the data, but it is used to check the validity of the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>A parity bit, or check bit, is a bit added to a string of binary code to ensure that the total number of 1-bits in the string is even or odd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>14</td>
<td>Parity bits are used as the simplest form of error detection code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>There are two types of parity bits: even parity bit and odd parity bit In the case of even parity:<br>if the number of bits is odd -&gt; count the number of ones<br>if the number of bits is even -&gt; count the number of zeros</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17</td>
<td>Bloking factor is number of records stored in a physical block.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>18</td>
<td>If we increase the blocking factor, we can decrease the number of blocks which decreases the number of gaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>19</td>
<td>Effective record density is a general measure of the effect of choosing different block sizes, amount of data that can be stored per inch of tape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>Space utilization is sensitive to the relative sizes of data block and interblock gaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>Effective recording density: Recording density after taking into account the space used by interblock gaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>22</td>
<td>Nominal recording density: Recording density on a tape without taking into account the effects of gaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>23</td>
<td>Effective transmission rate: Transmission rate after taking into account the time used to locate and transmit the block of data in which a desired record occurs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>24</td>
<td>Nominal transmission rate: Transmission rate of a tape without taking into account the effects of such extra operations such interblock gap traversal time.</td>

<tr>
<td>Popularity for Secondary Storage</td>
<td>Highly popular and has taken over much of <strong>secondary</strong> storage due to decreased cost of disk and memory storage</td>
<td>Not as popular as disks due to slower access time and higher cost per GB compared to disks (used as <strong>Tertiary</strong> storage)</td>
